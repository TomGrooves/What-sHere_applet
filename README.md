## A PWA to find nearby Points of interest - very WIP

 #### Current Features:

    * Uses geolocation to fetch nearby wikidata, providing an easy way to find nearby POI's.
    * Uses geolocation to fetch the local area name.
    * Allows installation of PWA
    * Usable on most devices

 #### To Do:
    
    * Add better caching and proper http headers in cross-site fetches
    * Add loading screen and await in order to ensure first load is good
    * Add options menu to allow for changing (cache settings, theme, etc.)
    * Optimize code and css, and add animations / effects
